## Moving away from Substack

I've moved the Dispatches from the Far Realms from Substack to [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email). For those that haven't heard, Substack continues to platform Nazis, white nationalists, and alt-right commentators. As a free-speech maximalist, I could *conceivably* accept a platform that allows all speech protected under the law. Protecting the ugliest speech protects everyone else, or so the thinking goes...

However, that's not the argument that Substack is making. Well, that's what they're *saying*, but their argument is intellectually dishonest because their terms of service *don't* protect everyone. Instead, they pick and choose what to allow, which speech is *valuable*, and means that racism and antisemitism are speech (or at least revenue) worth protecting in their eyes.

While I don't begrudge anyone who continues to uses Substack -- it is really the best set of tools for many creators -- and I will continue to subscribe to creators who do use it because moving your entire livelihood to a new platform is a perilous endeavor, I have the luxury of choice. So here we are.

## Amalara's values

- Diversity - Diversity is a strategic asset. Diversity of thought makes us stronger, not weaker.
- Empowerment - A narrative-focused game should be empowering for everyone at the table.
- Teamwork - Teamwork means people with complementary strengths working collaboratively toward a common goal. A high-performing team is capable of far more than the sum of its parts. We all succeed together.
